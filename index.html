            <p class="para">
              As a graduate in Mechanical Engineering, I have demonstrated a
              strong foundation in the principles of design, problem-solving,
              and analytical thinking. However, my passion for technology and
              coding has led me to pursue a career in web development. With a
              strong interest in programming, i have dedicated myself to
              learning various coding languages and frameworks, including HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Through self-study and online
              courses, I have developed a solid understanding of web development
              concepts and gained practical experience in building websites and
              web applications.I possess a strong work ethic and a willingness
              to learn, which will enable me to quickly adapt to new
              technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
